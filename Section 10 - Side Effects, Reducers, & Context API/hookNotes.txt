Rules of Hooks:
- only call React Hooks in React Functions (React Component Functions / Custom Hooks)
- Only call React Hooks at the Top Level (Dont call them in nested functions / Dont call them in any block statements)
- useEffect(): ALWAYS add everything you refer to inside of useEffect() as a dependency!
